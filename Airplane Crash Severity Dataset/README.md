# Predicting Severity of Aircraft crash

## Objective
- We have to predict the severity of the aircraft crash (Malignant or Benign).

## Approach & Implementation

- Dataset has been cleaned thoroughly.
- New intresting libraries like ppscore and lazypredict has been used here.
- LGBM Classifier model is used here.
- Hyperparameter have been tuned by experimenting with different values.
- The performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the confusion matrix and the F1 score.
