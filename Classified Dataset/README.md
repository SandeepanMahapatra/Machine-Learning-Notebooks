# Prediction in Classified Dataset
In this dataset, all the columns are classified i.e, we don't know what the dimensions signify. We don't have any insight on the data. All we have is unknown data. The head of the data is shown below.

## Objective

- To predict the value of TARGET CLASS with the help of various unknown parameters.

## Approach & Implementation

- Dataset has been cleaned thoroughly.
- EDA is not performed as it wasn't necessary.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed by using "elbow technique" to obtain the most accurate value of k.
-The performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the confusion matrix and the F1 score.
