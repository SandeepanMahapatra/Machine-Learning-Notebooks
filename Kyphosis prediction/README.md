# Prediction using D-Trees and Random Forest
This is a small dataset (81 columns). We have used both D-Trees and Random Forest classifier. Random forest model performed better.


## Objective

- We have to predict whether the corrective spinal surgery for kyphosis was successful or unsuccessful.

## Approach & Implementation

- Dataset has been cleaned thoroughly.
- Both D-Tree and Random Forest classifier is used here.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed by changing the value of n (number of estimators).
- The performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the confusion matrix and the F1 score.
