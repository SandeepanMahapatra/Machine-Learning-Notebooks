# Titanic Dataset
In this notebook I've used various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, XG-Boost and Random Forest Classifier.

## Objective

- To predict the survival of the passenger.

## Approach & Implementation

- Dataset has been cleaned thoroughly.
- Various relationships between the columns have been established using plotting libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
- Evaluation of the model has been calculated by the F1 score and the accuracy on the train set and the test set.
