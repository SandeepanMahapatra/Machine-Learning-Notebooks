# Boston House Pricing
This repository is one of my first dataset I've worked upon. Simple Linear Regression is used here.

## Objective

- To predict the price of the house with the help of various parameters.

## Approach & Implementation

- Dataset has been cleaned thoroughly.
- Various relationships between the columns have been established using plotting libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
- Evaluation of the model has been performed by metrics such as MSE and RMSE values.
