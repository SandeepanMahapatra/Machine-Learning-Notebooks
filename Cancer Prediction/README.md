# Prediction in Classified Dataset using D-Trees and Random Forest
In this dataset we are predicting that the cancer is Malignant or Benign with the help of SVM model.

## Objective
- We have to predict the type of cancer (Malignant or Benign).

## Approach & Implementation

- Dataset has been cleaned thoroughly.
- Support Vector Machine is used here.
- GridSearchCV was used to find the most suitable hyperparameters.
- The performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the confusion matrix and the F1 score.
