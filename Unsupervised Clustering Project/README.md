# Creating clusters with K-Means Clustering Algorithm
In this dataset we do have the output label just to test our model's performance unlike real-world data as it is unsupervised learning. Here, we have to clusters universities whether they are private or government.

## Objective
- We have to create clusters from the given data.

## Approach & Implementation

- Dataset has been cleaned thoroughly.
- K-Means model is used here.
- "Elbow" method is used to find the most suitable value for k(Number of clusters).
- The performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the confusion matrix and the F1 score although we don't really get any output labels in real-life unsupervised learning.
